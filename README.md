# contact-tracing
This repository includes source codes for contact tracing module, developed by WeCare in Sweden. We have combined strengths of [WeTrace](https://wetrace.ch/) and [DP3T](https://www.pepp-pt.org/) to implement a responsivve, scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for contact tracing.
